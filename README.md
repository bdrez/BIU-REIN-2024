# BIU-REIN-2024
Authors: Blimy Dresdner and Hannah Zahler

This project was developed starting in summer 2024 as part of the RE:IN gene networks project. Advised by Prof Hillel Kugler and PhD student Eitan Tannenbaum as part of the BIU-YU Summer ResearchÂ program.

The goal of this project is to convert a BNET and AEON files from the [biodivine-boolean-models repository on GitHub](https://github.com/sybila/biodivine-boolean-models) into REIN files that can then be processed by the reasoning engine to verify the set of constraints and specifications for each model, ensuring they are satisfiable by checking if solutions can be found.

- I. The first tool requires you to input the path to the BNET file from GitHub into the code. It then automates the creation of a file that can be imported into bioLQM to determine the fixpoints of the model.
